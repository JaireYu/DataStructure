  I like to travel to different places, because I can see beautiful scenery and understand different cultures. I always travel with friends, and we make many plans ahead of time. But plans are always interrupted by unexpected events, such as bad weather, cancelled holidays and so on, so we have to spend time waiting for the next trip. Traveling alone can ignore these problems, and I can travel anytime I want, just with a backpack and a ticket. It's so free. I don't have to wait for anybody else to go where I want to go. It's nice to travel alone.
  Summer is the best time of the year. No school, I want to do what I want to do, no homework, I like a free bird, I do a lot of things, summer vacation, through reading and watching TV to relax themselves, I also travel with my friends and my family. However, I do not play summer. I use my spare time to learn more. For example, I learned to swim last summer. I may learn computer or English this summer. Summer vacation is fast, so the important thing is to do it, you can.
  Everyone has their own dreams, so do I. But my dream is not a lawyer, not a doctor, not an actor, or even an industry. My dream may be ridiculous to adults, but this is what I have been pursuing. My dream is to have a colorful life. I want it to be a beautiful painting, it not only has bright colors, but also have dim colors, I do not rule out that this painting has a part of the black, but I will cherish these dim colors! Isn't it? How can a brightly colored painting stand out more beautifully if it doesn't have a bit of darkness? Life is like painting. The bright colors in the picture represent the beautiful and happy life. The dim colors in the painting represent difficulties and unpleasantness in life. Maybe you would think that it's not good to have a flat and beautiful road, but I don't think so. What does it mean for a person to have a flat life? Life is only a short span of decades. I want him to come to the last moment. Every memory is full.
