I like to travel to different places, I can see beautiful scenery and understand different cultures. I always travel with friends, we book a lot of plans in advance. But the plan is always interrupted by a variety of unexpected events, such as bad weather, holidays being cancelled, etc., so we have to spend time waiting for the next trip. I can ignore these problems when I travel alone. I can travel at any time, just pick up my backpack and buy a ticket. How free is that, I don't have to wait for other people to go where I want to go. It's great to travel alone.
